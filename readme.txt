<p><strong>Do you have <em>location specific</em> webpages on your website</strong>, like <em>contact information</em>, <em>store locations</em>, <em>products</em>, etc?</p>

<p>WPSSO Place and Location Meta (WPSSO PLM) works in conjunction with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization</a> plugin, extending its features with additional settings pages, tabs, and options, to include Facebook / Open Graph <em>Location</em> and Pinterest <em>Place</em> Rich Pin meta tags in your webpages. WPSSO PLM is <em>fast</em>, <em>efficient</em>, and &mdash; using WPSSO as its framework &mdash; provides <em>accurate</em> information about your content to social websites.</p>
